**Assignment Title:** Improved Property Management System with User Interface and Features

**Learning Objectives:**

* Gain practical experience with Django templates and forms.
* Implement user authentication and authorization.
* Develop interactive features like search, filtering, and dashboards.
* Understand the importance of user experience (UX) in web application design.
* Further practice collaboration and Git workflow.

**Assignment Description:**

Building on the models created in the previous assignment, you will now develop the front-end and user interface for the property management system. This involves creating Django templates, integrating user authentication, implementing search and filtering functionality, and designing dashboards for different user types.

**Requirements:**

1. **User Interface (UI) Design:**
    *   **Property Listing:** Create a visually appealing page to display property listings with key details (images, address, property type, rent).
    *   **Property Details:**  Create a detailed view for each property with comprehensive information and a photo gallery.
    *   **Image Uploads:** Allow users to upload images for properties.
    *   **Search and Filtering:** Implement search functionality to allow users to find properties based on criteria like location, property type, number of bedrooms, and price range.
    *   **User Authentication:** Implement user registration and login functionality.
    *   **User Roles:** Define user roles (e.g., admin, landlord, tenant) with different levels of access and permissions.
    *   **Dashboards:**
        *   **Admin Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard for administrators to manage all properties, units, tenants, leases, and user accounts.  Include visualizations and key metrics (e.g., occupancy rates, revenue).
        *   **Landlord Dashboard:** A dashboard for landlords to manage their properties, view tenant information, and track lease agreements.
        *   **Tenant Dashboard:** A dashboard for tenants to view their lease details, submit maintenance requests, and communicate with the landlord.

2. **Additional Features (Suggestions):**
    *   **Maintenance Requests:** Implement a system for tenants to submit maintenance requests and for landlords to track their status.
    *   **Payment Integration:** Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to allow tenants to pay rent online.
    *   **Messaging System:**  Allow communication between landlords and tenants within the platform.
    *   **Availability Calendar:** Display the availability of units with a calendar interface.

3. **Technical Requirements:**
    *   Use Django templates and forms to create dynamic web pages.
    *   Implement user authentication and authorization using Django's built-in authentication system.
    *   Use appropriate Django libraries and techniques for search and filtering.
    *   Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly across different devices.
    *   Write clean, well-documented, and maintainable code.

**Grading Rubric:**

*   **Functionality (50%):**  All required features are implemented correctly and efficiently.
*   **UI/UX Design (20%):** The interface is visually appealing, user-friendly, and intuitive.
*   **Code Quality (15%):** Code is well-organized, readable, follows PEP 8 guidelines, and is properly documented.
*   **GitHub Usage (15%):**  Consistent commits, clear commit messages, and effective collaboration demonstrated through the Git history.
